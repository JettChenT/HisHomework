Thorughout the vast history of China, many philosophies and ideologies were developed that continue to influence the world as we know it. And perhaps the most influencial of all of the philosophies is *confucianism*.

## How was confucianism developed

Confucianism was first developed in the *spring and autumn* dynasty, by perhaps the most famous Chinese philosopher: *Confucius*. *Confucius*' father was 60 years old, and his mother was younger then 20 years old when he was born. His father died when he was three, and he lived in poverty ever since. Later on he decided to dedicate his life in academical studies. *Confucious* had a extrodinary teacher: *Lao zi*, which happens to be the founder of another major philosophie in China: *Dao*. Afterwards he started his own school, promoting education for everyone. And the philosophies of *confucianism* developed ever since. And continued to do so after he died.

## The main teachings of confucianism and how they are used today

### Education

Education is an important part of this philosophy. Confucius has teached over 3000 students over his life, 72 of which are extrodinary, influencial, and itelligent. However, the education was different for different kinds of students, for nobles, he would teach them to manage the country using with the main ideologies of confucianism, with civillians, he would teach them various skills for them to make a living. Private education was also promoted in *confucianism*. The main teachings are still bring tought in today's schools throughout the world, especially in China, the main teachings are being taught as the most important of ideas in the Chinese history. They are used today to inspire and encourage the students to study harder and to respect their parents.

### Social order

Confucianism promotes that everyone should do what they're meant to do. The original teaching is: *"A ruler should do what a ruler should do, an adviser should do what an adviser should do, a father should do what a father should do, a son should do what a son should do "*. In this philosophy, people are grouped by families. A child should follow the child's parants' orders, and female follow male's orders, and a family works in this way, the the importance of a family was very high in the philosophies. The importance of family has always been defined by *confusianism*. And in today's society, all families, in some magnitude, was influenced by this  philisophy, as children are told to behave well and follow their parent's orders, etc. Although in nowadays, people try to break *confusianism*'s definition of a family, the impact remains, and it would be hard to break a tradition that shaped us for thousands of years.

### Politics

Confucianism promotes ruling the civilians through high moral standard. The opposite of this way of ruling is to rule the citizens by making laws. confucianism believes that if a ruler behaves in a high moral standard, the ruler's citizen would follow the ruler's orders, live peacefully, thus bringing social peace. The ruler should also treat the citizens well and put the citizens' need infront of their own needs. The advisers of the ruler should help the ruler maintain social order and follow the the teachings of *confucianism*. Although laws are enforced in all of the countries in the world, *confusianism* continues to impact the world today. Leaders still peak into the teachings of confusianism to maintain peace throughout the country and maintain stability inside the government.
